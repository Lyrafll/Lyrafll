### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lyrafll, an IT student currently learning at HEIG ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ and working as a software engineer at an insurance company.

My interests are as diverse as they come.
When I am not coding for school/work you'll find me brewing beer, competing in the world of Pokemon and working on tech projects that integrate these hobbies.
I also have an interest in RC planes and airsoft !
My sport to go is bouldering.

This GitHub repository (and mainly on other websites) is where I bring together technology and my diverse interests.
From coding experiments that involve PokÃ©mon data to self-regulated beer brewing applications, I love exploring new horizons.
You will also find a lot of abandoned projects (tho I keep them private until I feel they are ready)
